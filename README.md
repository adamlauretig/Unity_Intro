# Unity_Intro
An introduction to R on the Unity HPC cluster at Ohio State

The Unity cluster is free for ASC students at Ohio State, however, many students may have questions about working in an HPC enviroment.  I provide a simple example and documentation to get started with `R` on the unity cluster.

## Note
You will need to change `username.N` to your name.number in the .pbs file, and the bash code in the markdown file.

# Contents
1. `ASC_unity_R_intro.Rmd`: The R markdown file describing everything to run the tutorial, and commands to use.
2. `fake_data.rdata`: The simulated data for the demostration.
3. `generate_fake_data.R`: The script used to simulate the fake data.
4. `toy_function.R`: The `R` function to run on the cluster.
5. `demo_pbs.pbs`: The sample `.pbs` file.
